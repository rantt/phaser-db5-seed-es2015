#phaser-db5-seed-es2015

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [phaser.js](http://phaser.io) game.  You can use it to quickly test, build and deploy your phaser projects.

Based off of [phaser-db5-seed](https://github.com/rantt/phaser-db5-seed) with support for es2015. 

It includes a basic splash screen, loading bar and instruction panel.

##Getting Started

	npm install gulp -g
	npm install
	gulp init

This will download and install the necessary files to get started.

## Running With Scissors

Now you can just run 

	gulp

This will start a task that will watch for changes to files in the "src" directory.  When they are updated the webserver will automatically reload and jshint will get run, letting you know if there are any linting issues that need resolved.

## Packaging For Deployment

	gulp build

This will package up your game in the dist directory for deployment.

## Testing Dist

You can test the distribution package before deployment by running `gulp dist-server` to fire up a webserver from the "dist" folder.

## Deploying Your Project

Edit *rsync-config.json*

	{
	  "rsync": {
	    "username": "yourusername",
	    "hostname": "yourdomain",
	    "destination": "/path/on/server/"
	  }
	}

Change these settings to reflect your servers settings. Then run

	gulp deploy
	
to upload the game files to your server.
